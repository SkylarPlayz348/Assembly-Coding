# assembly-coding
This is where I will learn how to code in Assebly

### Structure Notes:
All x86 based assembly is in the `x86` folder this includes both x86 and x86_64/x64

All ARM based assembly is in the `ARM` folder this includes both 32 and 64 bit code

---
### Syntax Note:
I use `nasm` as my assembler for `x86`

I use the GNU Assmbler for `ARM`

ARM 64 bit will run on M Series MacBooks
